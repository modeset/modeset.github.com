# Mode Set Markdown User Theme

Mode Set CSS theme(s) for markdown files, tuned to work with
the Vim [markdown-preview][mdp] bundle.

This theme allows us to write all docs typically created in Apple's Pages, Google's Drive, or Microsoft's Word as markdown files and just export the generated html document to pdf.  

We &hearts; the Vim.
